            <h2>Problem Description</h2>

            <h3>Overview of Topic</h3>
            <p>Looking for housing in Seattle is difficult, especially for college students. Most students live on
                campus, but after their 3rd year, almost many more students move out to live off-campus. While college
                students are looking for housing, they are not informed about how safe the neighborhoods are. College
                students must access this information to choose where to live wisely. This is a significant issue to
                discuss because there are some places in Seattle where it's not
                safe for college students to be living. We might also be looking to assist anybody looking for a place
                to live rather than only focusing on college students.
            </p>
            <p>At the same time, with personal experience we have found that it is difficult to keep track of the list
                of apartments toured and there is not a designed website or application that can make a personalized
                pros and cons list. Making a personal comparision list is important for any decisions and choosing where
                to live is a big one.
            </p>

            <h3>Information Technology Problem</h3>
            <p>We are interested in making a website that will allow college students to look for an apartment/house
                around their college campus. Aside from looking for housing, our website offers to give students more
                information about the area they are interested in. We will be focusing on crime rate, sex offender rate,
                robbery rate, aggravated assault, etc. Well, anyone can google and search the crime rate in the area
                they are looking to move into, but it probably isn't the first thing that crosses their minds. This
                provided information gives the user the report they need to decide where to live.
            </p>

            <h3>Previous or Existing Solutions</h3>
            <p>There are many established websites for housing huntings and some of the more well-known ones include <a
                    href="https://www.apartments.com/">Apartments.com</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.zillow.com/">Zillow</a>. Both are similar in that they provide comprehensive
                information about the listings of apartments or houses. They usually include information like</p>
            <ul>
                <li>pricing</li>
                <li>floor plans</li>
                <li>availability</li>
                <li>amenities</li>
                <li>additional fees</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In our search of apartments around the University of Washington campus, both websites failed to mention
                specific amenities like study rooms that might be particularly helpful for students. Both Apartments.com
                and
                Zillow include features like location scores for walking and transit and also have a neighborhood map
                the
                users can interact with and explore. Apartments.com includes an addition interactive map for places of
                interest like restaurants, coffee shops, fitness, and shops. But the websites are not student eccentric
                and
                are lack of important information for commute like how long it takes to get to specific places on
                campus.
                Furthermore, they both do not have specific safety statistics like crime rates around the area, which is
                an
                important aspect when it comes to apartment hunting for students who often walks in the dark.
                Apartments.com
                does have a review section where users can leave reviews of specific apartment buildings but the reviews
                are
                mostly left by existing residents. Both Apartments.com and Zillow includes a "love" list where users can
                save interested houses or apartments, but they do not have functions where users can enter in their own
                notes about the apartment.</p>

            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>

            <h3>Users</h3>
            <p>The users of the application include students and other individuals interested in apartments in a
                specific area. The user can be someone interested in keeping track of the apartments they see while
                apartment searching and may also use information from our website during their search. Users can range
                in age from students in college looking for housing to new working professionals looking for affordable
                housing.</p>

            <h3>Information Shown</h3>
            <p>The users can view information such as apartment name, location, amenities, number of bathrooms, number
                of bedrooms, safety rating, and more. They are able to input information as well to keep track of the
                apartments they are interested in or have seen. The file we will use will look similar to the file
                linked <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mTho2ls6gaojOwb6inTKVAb8zu1Jsa5d/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100958801422115014555&rtpof=true&sd=true">here</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>User Interactions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The users will be able to organize and keep track of their searches by adding their searches and
                    saving them. They will receive information on the availability, price and the location of the
                    apartments. They will also have a section where they can input their own notes about the apartment
                    during their hunting process and create a pros and cons list.</li>
                <li>The users of this site will be able to search for available apartments in their desired residential
                    areas. Since we want to focus on location safety, they will also be able to check the crime rates
                    overall and against
                    certain demographics (Race, gender, sexual orientation) in a certain area. Our site will have a bar
                    graph that will show the percentage of crime in the specified city as compared to the national crime
                    rate.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why this App</h3>
            <p>Our website application will be a solution for University of Washington students who are looking for an
                apartment to live in. This solution has everything that current apartment hunting websites does and more
                with added statistics about location security and a section where users can input their own data. Our
                application is looking to ease the stress of apartment hunting and serves as an important tool for
                anyone looking for a place to live.
            </p>

            <p>University of Washington students, faculty and staff receive alerts from the UWPD Police letting us know
                that a crime has occured. We receive these messages so regularly that it is alarming. Students living
                within the University District wish that they knew how dangerous the residential area is because maybe
                that would have deterred them from living there. Our website gives students or recent graduates the data
                they will need in order to choose a home that is both safe and affordable. It gives them access to
                everything they are looking for in a home.
